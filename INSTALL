The most convenient way to install is using pip (best to make sure you
are using the most recent version of pip):

    pip install -U pip
    pip install seqmagick

If the above doesn't work or you want to install from a clone of the
project: First, install BioPython (http://www.biopython.org). NumPy
(which parts of BioPython depend on) is not required for seqmagick to
function but will most likely be installed as a dependency of
BioPython. Once done, install system-wide with:

    sudo python setup.py install

To install for a specific version of python:
    /path/to/python setup.py install

Yet another installation option:
    python setup.py install --home=/home/username/local
